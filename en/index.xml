We have also started a development team with two goals in mind: to create &amp;ldquo;functions&amp;rdquo; in the DeFi economy that are like natural laws of the Internet, and to create &amp;ldquo;tools&amp;rdquo; that make it easy for anyone to use the various functions. We hope to grow as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and a meeting place for DeFi and DeFier.</description></item></channel></rss>
