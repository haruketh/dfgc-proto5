Our main activities are to share information and industry awareness around DeFi, to support new DeFiers, and to develop smart contracts (Dapps).

We have also started a development team with two goals in mind: to create "functions" in the DeFi economy that are like natural laws of the Internet, and to create "tools" that make it easy for anyone to use the various functions. We hope to grow as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and a meeting place for DeFi and DeFier.

The predecessor of the DeFiGeek Community was TenX Community JAPAN, where supporters of the emerging crypto project TenX from before its ICO launch in 2017 gathered to share industry insights and interact with each other. More than four years have passed since then, and the industry has come a long way; DeFi has risen and flourished, and the momentum is only growing.

So instead of focusing on TenX, the old community members decided to transform the community into a broader DeFi-centric community in 2020 and beyond.

The community chat (Discord) is being expanded to include more channels to discuss various projects. We have a large number of members and experts with leading knowledge in the industry, and although it is a semi-closed community, the number of members has been steadily increasing.

Please look forward to its future development.
